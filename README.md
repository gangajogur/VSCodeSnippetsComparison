# VSCodeSnippetsComparison

Below is the comparison between VS Code extensions for Angular 2 code snippets from [Dan Wahlin (DW)](http://blog.codewithdan.com/2016/03/19/angular-2-typescript-and-html-snippets-for-vs-code/) and [John Papa (JP)](http://www.johnpapa.net/vscode-ng-snippets/).

My personal pick would be DW's as his extension has a few more snippets than JP's. Having said that, both of them work just as well but your preference might be different.  

This comparison came about when I saw the difference in the number of downloads between them at the time of writing this. 1790 (DW) compared to 24404 (JP).
