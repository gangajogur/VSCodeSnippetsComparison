# VSCodeSnippetsComparison

Below is the comparison between Angular 2 code snippets from [Dan Wahlin (DW)](http://blog.codewithdan.com/2016/03/19/angular-2-typescript-and-html-snippets-for-vs-code/) and [John Papa (JP)](http://www.johnpapa.net/vscode-ng-snippets/) for Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

In my opinion, Dan Wahlin's extension has lot more snippets than John Papa and are also a slightly more productive in couple cases.  

This comparison also came about when I saw the number of downloads for DW(1790) as compared to JP (24404).
