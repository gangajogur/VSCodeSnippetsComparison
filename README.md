# VSCodeSnippetsComparison

Below is the comparison between Angular 2 code snippets from [Dan Wahlin (DW)](http://blog.codewithdan.com/2016/03/19/angular-2-typescript-and-html-snippets-for-vs-code/) and [John Papa (JP)](http://www.johnpapa.net/vscode-ng-snippets/) for Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

Dan Wahlin's extension has a few more snippets than John Papa. Also in a few cases, personally, DW's extension is preferred.  

This comparison came about when I saw the difference in the number of downloads between them. 1790 (DW) compared to 24404 (JP).
